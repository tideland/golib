// The Tideland Go Library sml package provides a very simple markup language
// using a kind of LISP like notation with curly braces.
//
// The tag only consists out of the chars 'a' to 'z', '0' to '9'
// and '-'. Also several parts of the tag can be separated by colons.
// The package contains a kind of DOM as well as a parser and a
// processor. The latter is used e.g. for printing SML documents.
package sml

// EOF
